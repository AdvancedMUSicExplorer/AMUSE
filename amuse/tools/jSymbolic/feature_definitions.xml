   <feature>
      <name>Number of Common Melodic Intervals</name>
      <description>Number of different melodic intervals that each account individually for at least 9% of all melodic intervals.</description>
      <is_sequential>true</is_sequential>
      <parallel_dimensions>1</parallel_dimensions>
   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Initial Time Signature</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of two values. The first is the numerator of the first specified time signature in the piece, and the second is the denominator of the same time signature. Set to 4/4 if no time signature is specified.</description>
      <is_sequential>true</is_sequential>

   <feature>
      <name>Parallel Fifths</name>
      <description>Fraction of movements between voices that consist of parallel fifths (the fraction is calculated relative to the total amount of qualifying transitions, including all parallel, similar, contrary and oblique transitions). If more than two voices are involved in a given pitch transition, then each possible pair of voices comprising the transition is included in the calculation. Note that only transitions from one set of pitches to another set of pitches comprising the same number of pitches as the first are included in this calculation, although a brief lookahead is performed in order to accommodate small rhythmic desynchronizations (e.g. if a MIDI file is a transcription of a human performance). Only unique pitches are included in this calculation (unisons are treated as a single pitch). All pitches present are considered, regardless of their MIDI channel or track; this has the advantage of accommodating polyphonic instruments such as piano or guitar, but the consequence is that this feature does not incorporate an awareness of voice crossing.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Parallel Octaves</name>
      <description>Fraction of movements between voices that consist of parallel octaves (the fraction is calculated relative to the total amount of qualifying transitions, including all parallel, similar, contrary and oblique transitions). If more than two voices are involved in a given pitch transition, then each possible pair of voices comprising the transition is included in the calculation. Note that only transitions from one set of pitches to another set of pitches comprising the same number of pitches as the first are included in this calculation, although a brief lookahead is performed in order to accommodate small rhythmic desynchronizations (e.g. if a MIDI file is a transcription of a human performance).
