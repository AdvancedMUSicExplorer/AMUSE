For Chroma Toolbox:
------------------
The Chroma Toolbox has been developed by Meinard Müller and his collaborates from the 
research group headed by Michael Clausen. It contains MATLAB implementations for extracting 
various types of novel pitch-based and chroma-based audio features. The MATLAB implementations 
provided on this website are free for use in non-commercial research projects worldwide. 
If you publish results obtained using these implementations, please cite the references below,
