For Chroma Toolbox:
------------------
(Version 2.0. Last update: 2011-08-31)
The Chroma Toolbox has been developed by Meinard Müller and Sebastian Ewert.  It contains MATLAB implementations for extracting 
various types of novel pitch-based and chroma-based audio features. The MATLAB implementations are published under the terms of 
the General Public License (GPL). A general overview of the chroma toolbox is given in [1]. 

If you publish results obtained using these implementations, please cite [1]. For technical details on the features please cite [2], 
[3], [4], [5].
