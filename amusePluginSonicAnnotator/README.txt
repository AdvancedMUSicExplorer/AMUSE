For Sonic Annotator:
--------------------
Sonic Annotator (formerly known as “Runner”) is a command line program for batch extraction of audio
features from multiple audio files. The basic idea is to abstract out the process of doing the feature extraction
from the extraction methods, by using Vamp plugins for feature extraction. The output formats are RDF, CSV,
and others; new output formats can be added with a modest amount of programming work.
Sonic Annotator is conceived of as having two main uses within the OMRAS2 project. First, it is useful for
creating publishable feature data within the semantic web using the Music Ontology and Audio Features
Ontology. Secondly, it can be used to created feature lists for use with AudioDb.
Though the official name of this program is Sonic Annotator, the working name during development was
Runner, and the command-line examples in this document reflect the working name in some places. These may
change in future.
